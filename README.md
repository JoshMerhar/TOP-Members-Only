TOP's Members Only project. Created with Express (Node), Passport.js, PostgreSQL, and EJS.

All visitors can see messages written by other users, but only those who have solved the puzzle and gained access to the member area can see who wrote the messages and when. 

Anyone can create an account and submit messages. Members can see the message author and date/time of submission. Admins can delete messages in addition to member permissions.
